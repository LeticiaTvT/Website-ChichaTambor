              <h1>THE IMPORTANCE OF CORN</h1>
              <p>In the food industry, corn starch, derived from ground corn kernels, is added into various foods such as pasta, candies, sauces, breads, soups, stews, and baby food. Some edible oils and syrups are also made from corn, such as fructose and other sweeteners, used in most sodas or even juices sold in supermarkets. Processed corn is also used in medicines, cosmetics, glues, paper, textiles, paints, and solvents. Corn residues or “scraps” have recently been used to create biodegradable materials similar to plastics. Another use for corn is to use its sugars to make biodiesel fuel for use in cars and other vehicles.</p>
             <p>The corn plant is a tall annual grass with a stout, erect, solid stem. The large narrow leaves have wavy margins and are spaced alternately on opposite sides of the stem. Staminate (male) flowers are borne on the tassel terminating the main axis of the stem. The pistillate (female) inflorescences, which mature to become the edible ears, are spikes with a thickened axis, bearing paired spikelets in longitudinal rows; each row of paired spikelets normally produces two rows of grain. Varieties of yellow and white corn are the most popular as food, though there are varieties with red, blue, pink, and black kernels, often banded, spotted, or striped. Each ear is enclosed by modified leaves called shucks or husks.</p>

              <h1>CORN</h1>
              <h3><b>Uses and products</b></h3>
              <p>
                Corn is one of the world’s most productive and dominant crops. It is grown extensively as food for both humans and livestock, as a biofuel, and as a crude material in industry.</p>
                <h3><b>Food and nutrition</b></h3>
                <p>Corn is the third largest plant-based food source in the world. Despite its importance as a major food in many parts of the world, corn is inferior to other cereals in nutritional value. Its protein is of poor quality, and it is deficient in niacin. Diets in which it predominates often result in pellagra (niacin-deficiency disease). Corn is high in dietary fibre and rich in antioxidants.</p>

                  Export Plan
              </h1>
              <p>
                Thinking of ways to extend our market, we look for different options to reach out to our customers. Then we decide to export our product and make a huge hit; we choose to find two features that will have that country we will ship.  First since the chicha Fuerte is alcohol, we will look for the places that sell more alcohol like wine or beer. Second chicha Fuerte is a cultural drink so to promote the product we have to look for a country that has customers attracted to the culture and new beverages. In conclusion, United Stated is what we have seeking.    
              </p>
              <p>
                We make sure to have every documentation that is necessary for exporting to another country. When we are talking about transport chicha Fuerte, we choose the Maritime export, and the business in charge of exporting our delicate product is MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company.  

MSC serves both the alcoholic and non-alcoholic markets, offering fast and secure transport solutions worldwide transporting our product in the reefer. Reefer containers or refrigerated containers are used to transport goods requiring temperature-controlled conditions in transit.    
              </p>
              <p>
                Then a transportation truck will be positioned while the ship is arriving to unload the product and take it to the warehouse. Our store contracts will use their trucks to distribute the product in their stores.
